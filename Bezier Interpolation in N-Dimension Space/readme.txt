                   Bezier Curve
                   =============
bezierInterp.m
--------------
A function for Bezier interpolation for given four
control points. Each control point can be in N-Dimensional
vector space. Optionally a vector t can
be pass then bezier curve would be evaluated at
values stored in vector t. By default bezier curve
would be evaluated at 101 values between 0 and 1.
Ouput of function is evaluated values in N-Dimensional
vector space.

bezierInterpTest.m
-------------------
A test program that perform shows Bezier
interpolation for four sample control points in
1D, 2D, 3D, 4D vector space.
